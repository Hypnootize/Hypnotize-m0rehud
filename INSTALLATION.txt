1) Extract the hud and copy the Hypnotize-m0rehud folder

2) Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

NOTES:

In case you are using a 4:3, 5:4 or 16:10 aspect ration be sure to use the right patches in order to make the hud compatible with these resolutions.
You can find the patches inside the "Customizations" > "Resolutions Overrides" folder, open the folder that matches your aspect ration and take the "resource" folder in it, last replace it over the normal Hypnotize-m0rehud files!
