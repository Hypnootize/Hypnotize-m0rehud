1. Unzip the hud
2. Copy the Hypnotize m0rehud folder (not m0rehud-master)
3. Paste The folder to your custom folder
(C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Hypnotize m0rehud)

**Do not delete any file inside the Hypnotize m0rehud folder, doing so will make the hud crash/not work properly**
