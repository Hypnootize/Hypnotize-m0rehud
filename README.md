**Mix between Hypnotize Hud and m0rehud** 

**The only changes from the normal m0rehud are the custom menus and a few ingame changes like the spectator menu, freezecam and medic ubercharge**


<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract/Unzip the hud

**2)** Copy the Hypnotize m0rehud folder (**NOT** Hypnotize-m0rehud-Master, the one inside it!)

**3)** Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Hypnotize m0rehud)

**4)** Go to Resource/Fonts select all the font and install them (rightclick while selected and install)

**NOTES:**

In case you are using a **4:3, 5:4 or 16:10** aspect ration be sure to use the right patches in order to make the hud compatible with these resolutions.


<a>CUSTOMIZATION</a>
====

**1)** Choose which customization you want to apply and open the dedicated folder (each folder has a screen of the customization as well)

**2)** Copy all the folders found inside

**3)** Paste and replace them over the normal m0rehud files!

**Other than that is also possible to easily change the colors by editing the resource/scheme/colors.res file**

Inside that file is possible to change all the colors used for the health/ammo/buff/hurt/uber and many more!


<a>CROSSHAIRS</a>
====
All the hud crosshairs can be found inside the scripts/crosshairs folder!

It is possible to enable them from the crosshairs.res file by setting **"visible" "1"** for the wanted crosshair.

It is also possible to easily animate them so the crosshair turns red on damage by editing the HudAnimations_Crosshairs file, you can find all the instructions inside the file!
