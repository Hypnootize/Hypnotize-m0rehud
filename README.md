My own edit of m0rehud which consists in a mix between HypnotizeHUD, SunsetHUD and m0reHUD

The most notable differences from m0rehud are the modern menus and integrated minmode as well as some ui improvements here and there ðŸ‘€

*Note: this hud edit is mostly intended for 1080p*

<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract/Unzip the hud and copy the Hypnotize m0rehud folder

**2)** Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

**NOTES:**

In case you are using a **4:3, 5:4 or 16:10** aspect ration make sure to apply the patches in order to make the hud compatible with these resolutions.


<a>CUSTOMIZATION</a>
====

**1)** Choose which customization you want to apply and open the dedicated folder (each folder has a screen of the customization as well)

**2)** Copy all the folders found inside

**3)** Paste and replace them over the normal m0rehud files!

**Other than that is also possible to easily change the colors by editing the resource/scheme/colors.res file**

Inside that file is possible to change all the colors used for the health/ammo/buff/hurt/uber and many more!


<a>CROSSHAIRS</a>
====
All the hud crosshairs can be found inside the scripts/Crosshair.res file!

Change the **"visible"** value to **"1"** to enable the hud crosshair and change the **"labelText"** value to switch the crosshair style! checkout the Crosshairs.png in order to see all the possible options.

It is also possible to easily animate them so the crosshair turns red on damage by editing the **scripts/animations/HudAnimations_Crosshairs** file, you can find all the instructions inside the file!
